To address the lack of accessible legal support, we developed a chatbot that provides instant, scenario-based guidance for common legal situations.
Users can simply describe their issue in plain language—such as a property dispute, workplace issue, or consumer complaint—and the chatbot analyzes the input to suggest appropriate next steps.
It offers clear, non-technical explanations, points users toward relevant laws or resources, and helps them understand their rights and possible actions.
Designed to be easy to use and always available, this solution empowers individuals with timely legal awareness, without the need for immediate legal counsel
